# Remote-SDR
Remote-SDR remotely controls a SDR receiver and a SDR transmitter from a web browser. Pre-configured for the QO-100 Es'Hail 2 satellite transponder. Can be used for any NBFM, SSB or CW Radio from 1MHz up to 6 GHz. It can works in full duplex with Adalm-Pluto SDR, HackRF One, RTL-SDR or SA818.
Signal processing is done using gnuradio-companion and javascript. It runs on 1 or 2 Orange Pi One Plus single board computers under Armbian operating system to drive the SDRs. It runs also now on an Orange Pi Zero 2 with Armbian (Bullseye). It runs since version 2.4 on Raspberry 4 using Rasperry Pi OS.

Release v2.4 introduces the radio processing with a Raspberry Pi 4B.

Release 2.5 offers the processing of 2 HackRF One (TX and RX) by the Raspberry Pi 4B.

Release V3.0 introduces the Debian (Bullseye) operating system , GNU Radio 3.8 and an interface to Gpredict.

Release v4.0 introduces the new Raspberry OS (Bullseye) for the Raspberry Pi 4B.

Release v4.1 introduces CW signal processing and automatic CW manipulator.
