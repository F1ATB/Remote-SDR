# Remote-SDR
Remote-SDR remotely controls a SDR receiver and a SDR transmitter from a web browser. Pre-configured for the QO-100 Es'Hail 2 satellite transponder. Can be used for any NBFM, SSB or CW Radio from 1MHz up to 6 GHz. It can works in full duplex with Adalm-Pluto SDR, HackRF One, RTL-SDR, RSP1, RSP1A or SA818.
Signal processing is done using gnuradio-companion and javascript. It runs  on an Orange Pi Zero 2 with Armbian (Bullseye). It runs since version 2.4 on Raspberry 4 using Rasperry Pi OS.

Version 4.0 introduces the new Raspberry OS (Bullseye) for the Raspberry Pi 4B.

Version 4.1 introduces CW signal processing and automatic CW manipulator.

Version 4.2 introduces audio equalizers and noise filters.

Version 4.3 provides additional audio input/output to connect to external software (SSTV, FT8, Digi Modes..)

Version 4.4 allows IP ports selection to use Remote SDR via a NAT (Network Address Translation)

Version 4.5 introduces RTTY and frequency extension below 28MHZ for RTL-SDR V3

Version 5.0 is a complete redesign of the communications and the introduction of the SDR Play RSP1 and RSP1A.
